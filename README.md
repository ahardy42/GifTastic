Unit 6 HW for bootcamp - making a GIPHY API app

The app searches the GIPHY database and, when clicking the search button, does two things:

1. adds a button with the text of the search.  When clicked, this button will load 10 GIFs from the giphy API using the button text as a search term. 
2. loads 10 GIFs from the GIPHY API. 

the GIFs are loaded still, and when you click on them, they animate! The rating is listed below the GIF as well as a button (on devices only). when viewing from a computer screen you can drag and drop the GIFs into the favorites section.  On a device, it is easier to click a button with your finger so that is how you add the GIF to the favorites section. 

Have fun playing around searching for GIFs.
